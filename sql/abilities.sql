INSERT INTO `class_abilities` VALUES (1,'Fast Movement','Ex','','A [[class]]’s land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the [[class]]\'s land speed.'),(2,'Rage','Ex','','A [[class]] can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a [[class]] can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like bear\'s endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a [[class]] can rage per day. A [[class]] can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.\r\n\r\nWhile in rage, a [[class]] gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the [[class]] 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a [[class]] cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.\r\n\r\nA [[class]] can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A [[class]] cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a [[class]] falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.'),(3,'Rage Powers','Ex','? powers','As a [[class]] gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a [[class]] gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of [[class]] attained after 2nd level. A [[class]] gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the [[class]] to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a [[class]] cannot select an individual power more than once.'),(4,'Uncanny Dodge','Ex','','At 2nd level, a [[class]] gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if immobilized. A [[class]] with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.\r\n\r\nIf a [[class]] already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.'),(5,'Trap Sense','Ex','+?','At 3rd level, a [[class]] gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three [[class]] levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.'),(6,'Improved Uncanny Dodge','Ex','','At 5th level and higher, a [[class]] can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the [[class]] by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has [[class]] levels.\r\n\r\nIf a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.'),(7,'Damage Reduction','Ex','?/-','At 7th level, a [[class]] gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the [[class]] takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.'),(8,'Greater Rage','Ex','','At 11th level, when a [[class]] enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.'),(9,'Indomitable Will','Ex','','While in rage, a [[class]] of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.'),(10,'Tireless Rage','Ex','','Starting at 17th level, a [[class]] no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.'),(11,'Mighty Rage','Ex','','At 20th level, when a [[class]] enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.'),(12,'Bardic Knowledge','Ex','','A [[class]] adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.'),(13,'Bardic Performance',NULL,'','A [[class]] is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.\r\n\r\nStarting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the [[class]] is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.\r\n\r\nAt 7th level, a [[class]] can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a [[class]] can start a bardic performance as a swift action.\r\n\r\nEach bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.\r\n\r\nIf a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the [[class]] for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. A deaf [[class]] has a 20% change to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.\r\n\r\nIf a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the [[class]] for the performance to have any effect. A blind [[class]] has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.'),(14,'Countersong','Su','','At 1st level, a [[class]] learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal components.) Each round of the countersong he makes a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the [[class]] (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the [[class]]\'s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the [[class]]\'s Perform skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don\'t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.'),(15,'Distraction','Su','','At 1st level, a [[class]] can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the distraction, he makes a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the [[class]] (including the [[class]] himself) that is affected by an illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack may use the [[class]]\'s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the distraction, but it must use the [[class]]\'s Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don\'t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.'),(16,'Fascinate','Su','','At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.\n\nEach creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard\'s level + the bard\'s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature\'s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.\n\nFascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.'),(17,'Inspire Courage','Su','+?','A 1st level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard\'s performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.'),(18,'Versatile Performance','Ex','? skills','At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of Perform skill. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill\'s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.\n\nThe types of Perform and their associated skills are: Act (Bluff, Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate), Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate), Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).'),(19,'Well-Versed','Ex','','At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.'),(20,'Inspire Competence','Su','+?','A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard\'s performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).\n\nCertain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM\'s discretion. A bard can\'t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.'),(21,'Lore Master','Ex','?/day','At 5th level, the bard becomes a master of lore and can take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. A bard can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the bard can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.'),(22,'Suggestion','Sp','','A bard of 6th level or higher can use his performance to make a suggestion (as per the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). A bard can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance.\n\nA Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard\'s level + bard\'s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.\'),\n\n(\'Dirge of Doom\',\'Su\',\'A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to take become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard\'s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. The performance cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components.'),(23,'Inspire Greatness','Su','','A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target\'s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.'),(24,'Jack of All Trades','Ex','','At 10th level, the bard can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained. At 16th level, the bard considers all skills to be class skills. At 19th level, the bard can take 10 on any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed.'),(25,'Soothing Performance','Su','','A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the mass cure serious wounds, using the bard\'s level as the caster level. In addition, this performance removes the fatigued, sickened, and shaken condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.'),(26,'Frightening Tune','Sp','','A [[class]] of 14th level or higher can use his performance to cause fear in his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes frightened and flees for as long as the target can hear the bard\'s performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components.'),(27,'Inspire Heroics','Su','','A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.'),(28,'Mass Suggestion','Sp','','This ability functions just like suggestion, but allows a bard of 18th level or higher to make a suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated. Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability that relies on audible components.'),(29,'Deadly Performance','Su','','A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the target is staggered for 1d4 rounds, and the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24 hours. If a creature\'s saving throw fails, it dies. Deadly performance is a mind-effecting death effect that relies on audible and visual components.'),(30,'Dirge of Doom','Su','','A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to take become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard\'s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. The performance cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components.'),(31,'Cantrips','Sp','','[[class]]\'s learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells.  These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.'),(32,'Aura','Ex','','A [[class]] of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see the detect evil spell for details).'),(33,'Channel Energy','Su','?d6','Regardless of alignment, any [[class]] can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.\r\n\r\nA good [[class]] (or a neutral [[class]] who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil [[class]] (or a neutral [[class]] who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral [[class]] of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).\r\n\r\nChanneling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the [[class]]. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two [[class]] levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the [[class]]\'s level + the cleric\'s Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A [[class]] may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A [[class]] can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A [[class]] must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.'),(34,'Domains','Ex','','A [[class]]\'s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A [[class]] chooses two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A [[class]] can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that domain. If a [[class]] is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the [[class]], as well as a number of bonus spells. A [[class]] gains one domain spell slot for each level of [[class]] spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a [[class]] can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the [[class]] spell list, a [[class]] can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a [[class]] gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action. [[class]] domains are listed at the end of this class entry.'),(35,'Orisons','Sp','','[[class]] can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day.   These spells are treated like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.'),(36,'Spontaneous Casting','Sp','','A good [[class]] (or a neutral [[class]] of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The [[class]] can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).\r\n\r\nAn evil [[class]] (or a neutral [[class]] of an evil deity) can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).\r\n\r\nA [[class]] who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the [[class]] channels positive or negative energy (see channel energy).'),(38,'Spontaneous Casting','Sp','','A [[class]] can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature’s ally spell of the same level or lower.'),(39,'Nature Bond','Ex','','At 1st level, a [[class]] forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the [[class]] one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the [[class]]\'s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A [[class]] that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A [[class]] may begin play with any of the animals listed in Animal Choices. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the [[class]] on her adventures.\r\n\r\nUnlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion\'s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the [[class]] advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective [[class]] levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their [[class]] reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a [[class]] releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.'),(40,'Nature Sense','Ex','','A [[class]] gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.'),(41,'Wild Empathy','Ex','','A [[class]] can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her [[class]] level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.\r\n\r\nThe typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.\r\n\r\nTo use wild empathy, the [[class]] and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.\r\n\r\nA [[class]] can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.'),(42,'Woodland Stride','Ex','','Starting at 2nd level, a [[class]] may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.'),(43,'Trackless Step','Ex','','Starting at 3rd level, a [[class]] leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.'),(44,'Resist Nature’s Lure','Ex','','Starting at 4th level, a [[class]] gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as blight, entangle, spike growth, and warp wood.'),(45,'Wild Shape','Su','(? per day)','At 4th level, a [[class]] gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per [[class]] level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the [[class]] is familiar with.\r\n\r\nA [[class]] loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)\r\n\r\nA [[class]] can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a [[class]] can use wild shape at will. As a [[class]] in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.\r\n\r\nAt 6th level, a [[class]] can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a [[class]]’s wild shape now functions as beast shape II. When taking the form of an elemental, the [[class]]’s wild shape functions as elemental body I.\r\n\r\nAt 8th level, a [[class]] can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as beast shape III. When taking the form of an elemental, the [[class]]’s wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the [[class]]’s wild shape functions as plant shape I.\r\n\r\nAt 10th level, a [[class]] can use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the [[class]]’s wild shape now functions as elemental body III. When taking the form of a plant, the [[class]]’s wild shape now functions as plant shape II.\r\n\r\nAt 12th level, a [[class]] can use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the [[class]]’s wild shape now functions as elemental body IV.

Bonuses still accrue, and the [[class]] still dies of old age when her time is up.'),(49,'Bonus Feat','Ex','? feats','At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”\n\nUpon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.'),(50,'Bravery','Ex','','Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.'),(51,'Armor Training','Ex','','Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.\n\nIn addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.'),(52,'Weapon Training','Ex','','<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p><p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p><p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group.

he is wearing armor or using a shield.'),(54,'Weapon Mastery','Ex','','At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.'),(55,'AC Bonus','Ex','+?','When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.\n\nThese bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.'),(56,'Flurry of Blows','Ex','','Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When doing so he may make one additional attack using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with a special monk weapon (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham) as if using the Two-Weapon Fighting feat (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat). For the purpose of these attacks, the monk\'s base attack bonus is equal to his monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal base attack bonus.\n\nAt 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows, as if using Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).\n\nAt 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using Greater Two-Weapon Fighting (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).\n\nA monk applies his full Strength bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his flurry of blows attacks.'),(57,'Unarmed Strike','Ex','?','At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk\'s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.\n\nUsually a monk\'s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.\n\nA monk\'s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.\n\nA monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on Table: Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.'),(58,'Bonus Feat','Ex','? feats','At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk may select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list:\n\nCatch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything.\n\nAt 6th level, the following feats are added to the list:\n\nGorgon’s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility.\n\nAt 10th level, the following feats are added to the list:\n\nImproved Critical, Medusa’s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack.\n\nA monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.'),(59,'Stunning Fist','Ex','','At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, he can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.'),(60,'Evasion','Ex','','A [[class]] can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a [[class]] is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless [[class]] does not gain the benefit of evasion.'),(61,'Fast Movement','Ex','+? ft.','At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.'),(62,'Maneuver Training','Ex','','At 3rd level, a monk uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus when calculating his Combat Maneuver Bonus. Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are unaffected and are added normally.'),(63,'Still Mind','Ex','','A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.'),(64,'Ki Pool','Su','(?)','At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk\'s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 4th level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character\'s monk level. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. modifier. \n\nBy spending 1 point from his ki pool, a monk can make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool to give himself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.\n\nThe ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.'),(65,'Slow Fall','Ex','? ft.','At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm\'s reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent. When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk\'s ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.'),(66,'High Jump','Ex','','At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.'),(67,'Purity of Body','Ex','','At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n'),(68,'Wholeness of Body','Su','','At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a standard action. He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his ki pool.'),(69,'Improved Evasion','Ex','','At 9th level, a [[class]]\'s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless [[class]] does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.'),(70,'Diamond Body','Su','','At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.'),(71,'Abundant Step','Su','','At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from his ki pool. His caster level for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.'),(72,'Diamond Soul','Ex','','At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk\'s spell resistance.'),(73,'Quivering Palm','Su','','Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk\'s level + the monk\'s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.'),(74,'Timeless Body','Ex','','At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.'),(75,'Tongue of the Sun and Moon','Ex','','A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.'),(76,'Empty Body','Su','','At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell etherealness. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from his ki pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.'),(77,'Perfect Self','Ex','','At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk\'s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn\'t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type.');
